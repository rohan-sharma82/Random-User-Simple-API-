## 🚀 What’s Inside

🧩 **User Generation**  
> The project can instantly create up to **15 randomized user profiles**. No need for databases or forms—just pure mock data, ready to explore.

💡 Each user includes:
- Full Name 🧑
- Email Address 📧
- Profile Picture 🖼️
- Age, Gender, & Location 🌍
- Unique Password & ID 🔐

This makes it super handy for any data-driven demo, whether you're building a UI or analyzing demographics.

## 📊 Data Visualization

🗂️ **Tabular Summary**  
> All the user data is neatly organized into a table using `pandas`. This lets you sort, filter, or export it easily!

🎯 Key fields include:
- Name  
- Age  
- Gender  
- Email  

The table gives you a bird’s-eye view of all users—great for analysis or just visual clarity.

## 🌍 Grouping by Country

🧠 Ever wonder where your mock users “come from”?  
> The code groups users by **nationality code** like 🇺🇸 US, 🇬🇧 GB, 🇮🇳 IN and lists their names under each country. It's a fun way to explore diversity in randomly generated data.

## 💾 Save to CSV

📥 You can export the full user summary into a **CSV file** so it’s easy to share, load into Excel, or plug into another project.
